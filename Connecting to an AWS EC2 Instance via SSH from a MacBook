# Connecting to an AWS EC2 Instance via SSH from a MacBook

## Prerequisites
- An active AWS account and an EC2 instance running RHEL.
- A MacBook with macOS and Terminal access.
- An internet connection.

## Part 1: Setting Up Your EC2 Instance
1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
2. Navigate to the EC2 service and launch a new instance.
3. Select a RHEL AMI and configure your instance details.
4. Create and download a new key pair (.pem file) during the instance setup.

## Part 2: Generating an SSH Key Pair on Your MacBook
1. Open Terminal on your MacBook (use Spotlight to search for it).
2. Enter `ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"` and replace with your email.
3. Press Enter to accept the default file location.
4. Set a passphrase for your key when prompted.

## Part 3: Adding Your Public Key to Your EC2 Instance
1. Find your instanceâ€™s Public DNS/IP in the EC2 Dashboard.
2. SSH into your instance with `ssh -i /path/to/your/downloaded-key.pem ec2-user@instance-Public-DNS`.
3. Run `cd ~/.ssh` to go to the SSH directory.
4. Use a text editor to open `authorized_keys` with `nano authorized_keys`.
5. Paste the content of your public key file (`id_rsa.pub`) into `authorized_keys`.

## Part 4: Connecting to Your EC2 Instance from Your MacBook
1. Ensure the SSH-Agent is running with `eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"`.
2. Add your SSH private key to the agent with `ssh-add -K ~/.ssh/id_rsa`.
3. Connect to your EC2 instance via SSH with `ssh ec2-user@instance-Public-DNS`.
4. Accept the authenticity of the host if asked.
5. Enter your passphrase if you set one during key generation.

## Part 5: Troubleshooting Tips
- Ensure your EC2's security group rules allow SSH access on port 22.
- Confirm you are using the correct public DNS/IP address for your instance.
- Ensure you are using the right private key that matches the public key on the EC2 instance.
- Check the permissions of your `.ssh` directory and `authorized_keys` file.

## Conclusion
You can now interact with your EC2 instance's command line just as you would with a local terminal session.
